## Serverless
    •	Serverless and Application services
                    •	Event Driven Architecture
                    •	No constant running or waiting for things
                    •	Producers generate events when something happens
                    •	Clicks, errors, criteria met, uploads, actions
                    •	Events are delivered to consumers
                    •	Actions are taken and the system returns to waiting
                    •	Mature event-driven architecture only consumes resources while handling events (serverless ...)
                    •	Lambda Architecture
                    •	Function as a Service
                    •	Event driven invocation (execution)
                    •	Lambda function = piece of code in one lanuage
                    •	Lambda functions use a runtime (e.g. Python 3.6)
                    •	Runs in a runtime environment
                    •	You are billed only for the duration a function runs...(alternative to running compute on EC2)
    •	Key component of serverless architecture
                    •	When you create a Lambda function you really create a container
                    •	The container contains your code and the runtime environment
                    •	The best practice is to have the code timy and super specialized. And do one single thing.
                    •	Can be written in a large variety of languages
                    •	The runtime matches the language that your code is written.
                    •	Execution role (assign a IAM) to lambda function.  It has permissions to whatever the role allows.
                    •	Highly parallel forms of executions
                    •	Functions can access public internet resources
                    •	Functions can be configure to access private VPC (same level of access of the role)
                    •	Execution Role provides access to AWS services like DynamoDB and S3 for input and output (persistance storage for example)
                    •	Currently - 15 minute execution limit
                    •	New runtime environment every execution - no persistence
                    •	Load data from other services
                    •	Store data to other services (e.g. S3)
                    •	1M free request per month and 400K GB-seconds of compute time per month
    •  CloudWatchEvents and EventBridge
                    •	They allow you to implement an architecture which can observe if X happens or if something happens at a certain time so Y, the do Z.  X is a supported service which generates an event so it's a porducer of an event.  
                    •	Y can be a certain amount of time or a time periods and this is a specified using the UNIX Chrome format which a a flexible format.
                    •	Event bus for a single AWS account
                    •	stream service for any supported service inside an AWS account
                    •	2,  it's not a visible thing and not expose to UI
                    •	EventBridge you can create additional buses
                    •	Define rules that match patterns events 
                    •	When they see an event that matches a pattern they deliver event to a target.
                    •	An example of one target is to invoke a Lambda function
                    •	CloudWatch Events and EventBridge have visibility over events generated by supported AWS services within an account.
                    •	They can monitor the default account event bus - and pattern match events flowing through and deliver these events to multiple targets.
                    •	They are also the source of scheduled events which can perform certain actions at certain times of day, days of the week, or multiple combinations of both - using the Unix CRON time expression format.
                    •	Both services are one way how event driven architectures can be implemented within AWS.
     •	 API Gateway
                    •	API Gateway is a managed service from AWS which allows the creation of API Endpoints, Resources & Methods.
                    •	The API gateway integrates with other AWS services - and can even access some without the need for dedicated compute.
                    •	It serves as a core component of many serverless architectures using Lambda as event-driven and on-demand backing for methods.
    •	Serverless Architecture
                    •	Key to understanding serverless architecture (aside for the fact that there are servers behind the scenes) is that it's not one single thing.  
                    •	Serverless is an architecture but it's more a software architecture than a hardware architecture.
                    •	The goal is to manage few if any servers
                    •	Applications are a collection of small & specialised functions
                    •	Stateless and Emphemeral encironments - duration billing
                    •	Event-driven.. consumption only when being used
                    •	FaaS is used where possible for compute functionality
                    •	Managed services are used where possible
    •	Simple Notification Service
                    •	The Simple Notification Service or SNS .. is a PUB SUB style notification system which is used within AWS products and services but can also form an essential part of serverless, event-driven and traditional application architectures.
                    •	Publishers send messages to TOPICS
                    •	Subscribers receive messages SENT to TOPICS.
                    •	SNS supports a wide variety of subscriber types including other AWS services such as LAMBDA and SQS.
                    •	Public AWS service - network connectivity with public endpoint.
                    •	Coordinates the sending and delivery of messages
                    •	Messages are <= 256KB payloads
                    •	SNS Topics are the base entity of SNS - permissions and configuration
                    •	A publisher sends messages to a TOPIC
                    •	TOPICS have Subscribers which receive messages
                    •	e.g. ... HTTP(s), Email(JSON), SQS, Mobile Push, SMS Messages & Lambda
                    •	SNS used across AWS for notifications - e.g. CloudWatch and CloudFormation
                    •	Delivery Status (including HTTP, Lambda, SQS)

                    •	Wait -  certain period of time or date and time
                    •	Choice - state which allows the state machine to take a different path depending on the input
                    •	Parallel -  allows to create parallel branches within a state machine.
                    •	MAP - accepts a list of things.  Each item that map state performs actions bases on those items

    •	Simple Queue Service
                    •	SQS queues are a managed message queue service in AWS which help to decouple application components, allow Asynchronous messaging or the implementation of worker pools.
                    •	Public, Fully Managed, Highly-Available Queues -  Standard or FIFO
                    •	FIFO guarantee an order - Best Effort - 3K messages per second with batching

                    •	Federal Identities - SWAP Google, Facebook, Twitter, SAML 2.0 and User Pool for short terms AWS Credentials to access AWS Resources
                    •	A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito.
                    •	Your users can also sign in through social identity providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple, and through SAML identity providers. Whether your users sign in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).
                    •	Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities) enable you to create unique identities for your users and federate them with identity providers. With an identity pool, you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services.
