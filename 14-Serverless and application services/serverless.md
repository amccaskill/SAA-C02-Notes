•	Serverless and Application services
•	Event Driven Architecture
•	No constant running or waiting for things
•	Producers generate events when something happens
•	Clicks, errors, criteria met, uploads, actions
•	Events are delivered to consumers
•	Actions are taken and the system returns to waiting
•	Mature event-driven architecture only consumes resources while handling events (serverless ...)
•	Lambda Architecture
•	Function as a Service
•	Event driven invocation (execution)
•	Lambda function = piece of code in one lanuage
•	Lambda functions use a runtime (e.g. Python 3.6)
•	Runs in a runtime environment
•	You are billed only for the duration a function runs...(alternative to running compute on EC2)
•	Key component of serverless architecture
•	When you create a Lambda function you really create a container
•	The container contains your code and the runtime environment
•	The best practice is to have the code timy and super specialized. And do one single thing.
•	Can be written in a large variety of languages
•	The runtime matches the language that your code is written.
•	Execution role (assign a IAM) to lambda function.  It has permissions to whatever the role allows.
•	Highly parallel forms of executions
•	Functions can access public internet resources
•	Functions can be configure to access private VPC (same level of access of the role)
•	Execution Role provides access to AWS services like DynamoDB and S3 for input and output (persistance storage for example)
•	Currently - 15 minute execution limit
•	New runtime environment every execution - no persistence
•	Load data from other services
•	Store data to other services (e.g. S3)
•	1M free request per month and 400K GB-seconds of compute time per month
	CloudWatchEvents and EventBridge
•	They allow you to implement an architecture which can observe if X happens or if something happens at a certain time so Y, the do Z.  X is a supported service which generates an event so it's a porducer of an event.  
•	Y can be a certain amount of time or a time periods and this is a specified using the UNIX Chrome format which a a flexible format.
•	Event bus for a single AWS account
•	stream service for any supported service inside an AWS account
•	2,  it's not a visible thing and not expose to UI
•	EventBridge you can create additional buses
•	Define rules that match patterns events 
•	When they see an event that matches a pattern they deliver event to a target.
•	An example of one target is to invoke a Lambda function
•	CloudWatch Events and EventBridge have visibility over events generated by supported AWS services within an account.
•	They can monitor the default account event bus - and pattern match events flowing through and deliver these events to multiple targets.
•	They are also the source of scheduled events which can perform certain actions at certain times of day, days of the week, or multiple combinations of both - using the Unix CRON time expression format.
•	Both services are one way how event driven architectures can be implemented within AWS.
	API Gateway
•	API Gateway is a managed service from AWS which allows the creation of API Endpoints, Resources & Methods.
•	The API gateway integrates with other AWS services - and can even access some without the need for dedicated compute.
•	It serves as a core component of many serverless architectures using Lambda as event-driven and on-demand backing for methods.
	Serverless Architecture
•	Key to understanding serverless architecture (aside for the fact that there are servers behind the scenes) is that it's not one single thing.  
•	Serverless is an architecture but it's more a software architecture than a hardware architecture.
•	The goal is to manage few if any servers
•	Applications are a collection of small & specialised functions
•	Stateless and Emphemeral encironments - duration billing
•	Event-driven.. consumption only when being used
•	FaaS is used where possible for compute functionality
•	Managed services are used where possible
	Simple Notification Service
•	The Simple Notification Service or SNS .. is a PUB SUB style notification system which is used within AWS products and services but can also form an essential part of serverless, event-driven and traditional application architectures.
•	Publishers send messages to TOPICS
•	Subscribers receive messages SENT to TOPICS.
•	SNS supports a wide variety of subscriber types including other AWS services such as LAMBDA and SQS.
•	Public AWS service - network connectivity with public endpoint.
•	Coordinates the sending and delivery of messages
•	Messages are <= 256KB payloads
•	SNS Topics are the base entity of SNS - permissions and configuration
•	A publisher sends messages to a TOPIC
•	TOPICS have Subscribers which receive messages
•	e.g. ... HTTP(s), Email(JSON), SQS, Mobile Push, SMS Messages & Lambda
•	SNS used across AWS for notifications - e.g. CloudWatch and CloudFormation
•	Delivery Status (including HTTP, Lambda, SQS)
•	Delivery Retries - Reliable Delivery
•	HA and Scalable (Region)
•	Server Side Encryption
•	Cross-Account via TOPIC Policy
	Step Functions
•	Step functions is a product which lets you build long running serverless workflow based applications within AWS which integrate with many AWS services.
•	State Machines
•	Serverless workflow .. START -> STATES -> END
•	Startes are THINGS which occur
•	Maxium Duration 1 year
•	Standard Workflow and Express Workflow
•	Startted via API Gateway, IOT Rules, EventBridge, Lambda ....
•	Amazon States Language (ASL) - JSON Template
•	IAM Role is used for permissions
•	States
•	Things that occur inside a workflow
•	Success and Fail
•	Wait -  certain period of time or date and time
•	Choice - state which allows the state machine to take a different path depending on the input
•	Parallel -  allows to create parallel branches within a state machine.
•	MAP - accepts a list of things.  Each item that map state performs actions bases on those items
•	TASK - single a unit of work by a state machine -  can be integration into many services. (Lambda, Batch, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, Glue, SageMaker, EMR, Step funtions)
•	Simple Queue Service
•	SQS queues are a managed message queue service in AWS which help to decouple application components, allow Asynchronous messaging or the implementation of worker pools.
•	Public, Fully Managed, Highly-Available Queues -  Standard or FIFO
•	FIFO guarantee an order - Best Effort - 3K messages per second with batching
•	Standard - at least once, no guarantee of order
•	Messages up to 256KB in size - link to large data
•	Received messages are hidden (Visibility Timeout) 
•	then either reappear (retry) or are explicitly deleted
•	Dead-Letter queues can be used for problem messages
•	ASG can scale and Lambdas invoke based on queue length
•	Short (immediate) vs Long (waitTimeSeconds) Polling
•	Billed based on 'request'
•	Encryption at rest (KMS) and in transit
•	Kinesis and Kinesis Firehose
•	Kinesis data streams are a streaming service within AWS designed to ingest large quantities of data and allow access to that data for consumers.
•	Kinesis is ideal for dashboards and large scale real time analytics needs.
•	Kinesis data firehose allows the long term persistent storage of kinesis data onto services like S3
•	Kinesis is a scalable streaming service
•	Producers send data into a kinesis stream
•	Streams can scale from low to near infinite data rates
•	Public service and highly available by design
•	Streams store a 24-hour moving window of data
•	Multiple consumers access data from that moving window
•	Kinesis Architecture
•	Kinesis Stream uses shard architecture
•	Kinesis Data record (1MB)
•	Stored (window) 24 Hour Window up to 7 days
•	Amazon Cognito
•	Authentication, Authorization, and user management
•	USER POOLS - sign in and get a JSON Web Token (JWT)
•	User directory management and profiles, sign-up and sign in (customizable web UI), MFA and other security features
•	Can't be used to directly access AWS resources or services
•	IDENTITY POOLS Allow you to offer access to Temporary AWS credentials
•	Unauthenticated identities - Guest Users
•	Federal Identities - SWAP Google, Facebook, Twitter, SAML 2.0 and User Pool for short terms AWS Credentials to access AWS Resources
•	A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito.
•	Your users can also sign in through social identity providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple, and through SAML identity providers. Whether your users sign in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).
•	Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities) enable you to create unique identities for your users and federate them with identity providers. With an identity pool, you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services.
