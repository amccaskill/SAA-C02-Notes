Essential Characteristics:
1. On demand self service
   Consumer should be able to provision computing capabilities without requiring human interaction
2. Broad Network Access
   Capabilities are avialable over the network using standard protocols and accessed through any standard device (laptop, phone)
3. Resource Pooling
   Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model
4. Rapid Elasticity
   Able to scale rapidy outward and inward with demand. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released (in some cases automatically)
5. Measured Service
   Automatically control and optimize resource.  Resource can be monitored, controlled and reported, providing transparency.


Cloud architectures:
1. Public - 1 cloud Environment
2. Private - on premise / AWS outpost/ Azure/ Google Anthos
3. Hybrid - Public cloud and private cloud != (doesnâ€™t) public cloud and on premise (legacy)
4. Multi - Multiple cloud Environment, cloud level resilience (HA)
